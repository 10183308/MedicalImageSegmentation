# Medical Image Segmentation

This repository contains part of the work we conduct at LIVIA that can be made publicly available. The main focus on our research to segment medical images is on deep learning models and optimization techniques.

This is the current content of this repository:

## - LiviaNET. 3D fully Convolutional Neural Network for semantic image segmentation [Link](https://github.com/LIVIAETS/MedicalImageSegmentation/tree/master/LiviaNET)

This repository contains the code of LiviaNET, a 3D fully convolutional neural network that was employed in our work: [3D fully convolutional networks for subcortical segmentation in MRI: A large-scale study](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811917303324) Neuroimage, April,17th 2017.

## - SemiDenseNet. Semi-dense connectivity to segment infant brain tissue in multi-modal images [Link](https://github.com/LIVIAETS/MedicalImageSegmentation/tree/master/SemiDenseNet)
This repository contains the code of the network that we employed in the iSEG Grand MICCAI Challenge 2017, infant brain segmentation. This network extends out previous work in 3D fully convolutional neural network that was employed in our work: [3D fully convolutional networks for subcortical segmentation in MRI: A large-scale study](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811917303324), which can be found here : (https://github.com/josedolz/LiviaNET/).
